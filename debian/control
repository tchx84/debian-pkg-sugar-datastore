Description: Sugar graphical shell - datastore
 Sugar is a graphical user interface aimed at children.
 .
 Originating as integral part of the OLPC "XO" a.k.a. the $100 laptop,
 Sugar has since grown into a more widely usable low-ressource desktop
 environment for kids.
 .
 This package contains a simple log like datastore able to connect with
 multiple backends.  The datastore supports connecting and disconnecting
 from backends on the fly to help the support the limit space/memory
 characteristics of the OLPC system and the fact that network services
 may become unavailable at times.
